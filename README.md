## Game AI
Deveolop a machine learning algorithm based off deepmind's AlphaZero that is able to learn how to play two player games of perfect information (Ex: chess, checkers ect..) simply by playing itself. While the ai will have some specific inputs/outputs based on the game it should be able to learn and hopefully beat some humans without any additonal human data. 

Some notable components:
* Neural Networks
* Monte Carlo Search Trees
* Minimax Trees

Implementation possibilities:
* In python that way I can easily integrate it with ML libraries like tensor flow but I might try to make my own ML lib from scratch.
* In C# and possibly also python via pipes 
* Probably a desktop application with possibiliy of being to put a trained model on a website

## Bitmap to Vecor Graphics
Develop some sort of algorithm that is able to convert bitmap formats like png to vector graphics like svg or eps possibly using machine learning. I have a far clearer picture of how this project would even go but it is really interesting and more practical than the previous idea. 

Misc Ideas:
* Use edge detetion and other computer graphics techiques
* Have some sort of text detection and be able to find similar looking fonts
* Break image up into small chunks that can be shaded using machine learning

Implementation possibilities: See Game AI Implementation
